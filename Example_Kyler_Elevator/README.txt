To create a log file:

Right click in folder and run bash prompt here

in the bash prompt window type 'make'

after some time, a new file named elevatorKyler.exe will appear in the folder

in the bash prompt window type './elevatorKyler'

a log file will then be generated

Afterwards make sure to do 'make clean', this will erase the files that were made if they are still in the folder
